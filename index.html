      <h2>Intro...</h2>
      <p>A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. Here, I'll talk about three types;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="three">
      <h3> #1: Equilateral triangle.</h3>
      <p>This is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="four">
      <h4>#2: Isosceles triangle.</h4>
      <p>This is a triangle that has two sides of equal length.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="five">
      <h5>#3: Scalene triangle.</h5>
      <p>This  is a triangle that has three unequal sides</p>
    </div>
    <div class="six">
      <h6>Finally...</h6>
      <p>It's good to note that I've assumed that a triangle is "Not A Triangle" if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side. </p>
