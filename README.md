## Description
This is an application that will help us know whether a triangle is isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NOT a triangle at all according to the user's input.It's good to note that I've assumed that a triangle is "Not A Triangle" if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side.
